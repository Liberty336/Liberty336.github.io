     <p class="about-index">Liberty336 is NOT the "3 percenters" (III%ers), we are not the "proud boys", etc. These groups are things that came from the "Militia Movement" after Waco and Ruby Ridge. Liberty336 is a different breed and we did not come from the "Militia Movement". We formed out of necessity in December of 2020.
<br><br>
     In order to thoroughly understand Liberty336, you need to understand oldschool 1770-1792 style American militias, and then understand Liberty336 is a just a modern version of that with some key differences. Many groups that claim to be a “militia”, such as Proudboys, are completely different in every aspect from the “militia” being discussed here. As a foundation, you have to learn some information from this short history lesson.
     <br><br>

American militias have existed on the American continent long before the battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19th, 1775. They helped to build the system that maintained American civilization that led to "America" in the first place. American Militias not only defeated the British Military forces in the battles of Lexington and Concord, they also engaged in and won the Boston Siege. America did not even have a continental army until later on June 14th, 1775, and militias would continue to participate in combat throughout the war.
<br><br>
Some American Militias were entities of the local colonial government, but many militias were entities of the people themselves. These independent militias were farmers, blacksmiths, sailors, military veterans, philosophers, carpenters, etc. One example of an independent militia is The Green Mountain Boys, which were formed in 1770 and lead by Ethan Allen. Ethan Allen was an American farmer, businessman, land speculator, philosopher, writer, lay theologian, American Revolutionary War Patriot, and founder of Vermont. As you can see, Ethan Allen was a very competent and active individual, and he participated in an independent militia. These militias were not groups of “dumb rednecks”. These militias were “well regulated” entities of the people.
     <br><br>
     For those who don't know, in 1700’s English, “well regulated” when used in reference to militias was defined as:
     <br>
     <br>

  1. Well Armed/Equipped
     <br>
  2. Well Trained/Disciplined
     <br>
  3. Well Organized/Prepared
<br>
<br>
Some other examples of independent militias in America include Colonel George Mason forming an Independent Militia in Virginia in 1774.

     <br><br>

Later in time, after the American Revolution was won and the US Constitution was created, the newly formed US Federal Government in the year of 1792 created a Federal law known as The Militia Act of 1792.<br><br>
Source: https://www.mountvernon.org/education/primary-sources-2/article/militia-act-of-1792/
<br><br>
The 2nd version of the Militia Act of 1792 required every white male who was 18 years old or older, to own a functioning firearm, and he would be required to get in touch with his local militia and then immediately enroll. After enrolling, he would meet with his local militia at least once a month.
<br><br>
Here is why this is significant, although these meetings were made for serving the purpose of having a citizen population with militant skills that would be prepared to serve in case of emergency, these events unintentionally served other purposes that had a positive effect on both the individual and the collective.
<br><br>
If a man was having trouble finding work, there were connections within the militia that could help him find work. If a 17 year old was struggling with a personal problem in regards to his character development, there were plenty of “father figures” that could aid this 17 year old into becoming a mature man. Additionally, these meetings helped to create a sense of mutual respect and “camaraderie” among the people. It is very easy to be apathetic to a stranger, but there are no strangers in your community when you get to know everyone by name and meet them at least once every month.
<br><br>
Liberty336 is a modern version of the oldschool 1770-1792 style militias. Every member of Liberty336 is required to meet and train with his/her fellow members. Liberty336 serves the purpose of reviving, growing, and maintaining a “well-regulated” modern version of this culture for the modern world. Liberty336 wants a culture that applies to <strong><u>everyone</u></strong>, regardless of their race or gender. Everyone in a community should feel loved and welcomed by their neighbors within their own neighborhood, rather than just tolerated. It is much easier to grow this mutual attitude among a community that regularly trains together, learns together, and works together.  This is what Liberty336 means when we say “1770-1792 culture”.
