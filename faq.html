    <h2 id="what-is-liberty336">Question: What is Liberty336?</h2>
    <br>
    <h3 class="qah3">Answer: Liberty336 is a non-partisan humanitarian 1770-1792 style militia that serves the people of the 336 area code of North Carolina. We are made up entirely of volunteers. We were founded in December of 2020.
      <br><br>
      Liberty336 is NOT a group of "Gravy SEALs", nor do we fly the Confederate "Stars and Bars". Our number one obstacle is overcoming misconceptions about who we are and what we do.<h3>

    <div class="qa">
    <h2 id="legal">Question: Aren't "militias" illegal?</h2>
    <br>
    <h3 class="qah3">Answer: No. In fact, under NC General Statutes 127A-7, if you are 17 or older,
      you are already in the "Unorganized Militia". The concept that "militias are illegal"
      is a common misconception due to articles like
      <a style="color:#37a649;" href="https://nccriminallaw.sog.unc.edu/militias-in-north-carolina/">this</a>.
      NC's laws on militias can be found by reading NC General Statutes
      <a style="color:#37a649;" href="https://www.ncleg.gov/Laws/GeneralStatuteSections/Chapter127A">Chapter 127A</a>
  <br>
  <br>
    What IS illegal is for a private group of citizens to engage in State sanctioned activities that are reserved
    for Government (like police). For example, setting up checkpoints, making arrests, etc, are activities done by Government entities.
      <br>
      <br>
      Some Militias are registered Government entities with the State Government.
      An example is the <a style="color:#37a649;" href="http://navalmilitia.ohio.gov/">Ohio Naval Militia</a>.
      So to say that "militias are illegal" when there are militias registered and authorized by the Government is incorrect.
      <br><br>
      These laws do not apply to Liberty336 because Liberty336 does not engage in activities reserved for the Government.
      We are a "militia" by the oldschool 1770-1792 standards of independent militias like The Green Mountain Boys.
      <br><br>
      Here's a fun history fact, independent militias are older than the United States and a part of American culture.
      You can read
      <a style="color:#37a649;" href="https://allthingsliberty.com/2014/09/the-rise-of-virginia-independent-militia/"> this article for more info.</a>

    <h2 id="liberty336-purpose">Question: What is the purpose of Liberty336?</h2>
    <br>
    <h3 class="qah3">Answer: Liberty336 serves the purpose of reviving and maintaining a "well regulated" 1770-1792 style militia of the people themselves, as well as serving the people of the 336 area code of North Carolina in various ways.
      <br><br>
      When referring to militias in 1700's English, "Well Regulated" meant Well Armed/Equipped, Well Trained/Disciplined, Well Organized/Prepared. You can read letters written during the time period to prove this.
    <br>
    <br>
    We have done food donations, picked up trash, created educational content, and more. If you are interested in serving your community in an interesting way, consider joining. There is plenty of work to do.

    <div class="qa">
    <h2 id="1770-1792-style">Question: What is a "1770-1792 style militia"?</h2>
    <br>
    <h3 class="qah3">Answer: Before we can answer, we have to provide some background and context. Here are some videos to help you. A "Militia" by 1770-1792 standards is a "well-regulated" group of people who serve their people by defense and community service. The Green Mountain Boys were an independent militia that served it's people in the 1770's by protecting land of property owners. Later in time they served their people with defense in the Revolutionary War.
    <br><br>
        When people hear the word "Militia" they are thinking of groups like the "Oath Keepers", "pAtRiOt FrOnT", etc. <br><br>
      WE ARE NOT LIKE THESE GROUPS.
<br><br>
        In our eyes, these groups are "gun clubs" where men shoot guns and drink beer. We do not consider these groups to be "militias". There are 2 main reasons for this.
<br><br>
      1) As far as we're aware, they have never stood up to "tyranny" in defense of the people. Militias like the "Pharaoh's Guard" have. Here is a video as an example.
      <br><br>
To give context on this video below, there was a Black Lives Matter protest in Kentucky the day before this video was taken. Even though this protest was *actually* peaceful (no looting, rioting, etc), the police ruled it to be an "unlawful assembly" and illegally dispersed the protesters. That is violation of the 1st amendment in America.
The next day (which is the day this video was taken), the Pharaoh's Guard Militia went out to accompany the protesters. As you can see, the police did not disperse the crowd this time.</h3>

      <h3 class="qah3">
2) These groups are more well known for hanging around polling places than they are for providing community service. Meanwhile, groups like the Black Panther's have. The Black panthers have provided food, free EMT services, education, etc.
 The Black Panthers are more qualified to be a 1770-1792 style "militia" than most of these other groups are. The main differences between Liberty336 and the Black Panthers is that the Black Panthers were communist, we are not.
 Black panthers we also ethnically black, Liberty336 is a mixed race group that accepts all races and ethnicities.</h3>

    <div class="qa">
    <h2 id="boog">Question: Is Liberty336 part of the Big Igloo Movement?</h2>
    <h3 class="qah3">Answer: NO!! The "Big Igloo" movement is a decentralized idea that anyone can claim to be a part of.
      Liberty336 is an organization with official members and rules, and you have to graduate training before you become a member.
      Although Liberty336 and the "Big Igloo boys" share some stuff in common,
      (such as valuing liberty, wanting criminal justice reform) we are VERY different when it comes to ideology,
      how we do our work and what steps we think are best to take.

      WE ARE NOT BOOGALOO/BIG IGLOO!!!</h3>

    <h2 id=#join>Question: How can I join?</h2>
    <br>
      <h3 class="qah3">Answer: You start by contacting us. Joining Liberty336 takes some time.
      <br><br>
      The 2 most important things we look at are:
      <br>1) Your Character (Are you honest? Do you have integrity?)
      <br>2) Your Ideology (Do you REALLY support free speech?)
      <br><br>
      In order to join, you can send an e-mail to liberty336@protonmail.com. Be sure to include your first name, last name, and date of birth.
      We will run a background check on you to see if you're a registered sex offender, felon, etc. Minor offenses most likely won't disqualify you.
      <br>
      After the background check, if we like what we see, we will offer to interview you. If that goes well, you will begin training.
      If you pass training and STILL want to join, we will move forward and you will officially become a "libertine", a member of liberty336.

    <h2 class="qah2" id="liberty336-help">Question: Can I ask Liberty336 to help me with my community project/organization?</h2>
    <br>
    <h3 class="qah3">Answer: Maybe. Depends on what it is. Whether a member decides to volunteer is their consented decision,
      so some may volunteer, some may not. Some of our members volunteered for the American Red Cross in Reidsville before
      it was closed. E-mail us at liberty336@protonmail.com and give us more info.</h3>

  <h2 id="trumpers">Question: Aren't you just a bunch of Trumpers?</h2>
  <br>
    <h3 class="qah3">Answer: LMAO! No.</h3>
  <br>
  <br>
  <img class="faq-trumpers" src="https://liberty336.com/images/maga-cry.jpeg">
  <br>
  <br>
<h3 class="qah3">
  Liberty336 is "non-partisan". Non-partisan in this context is defined as: "Not owing allegiance, ideology, or membership to a political party".
<br><br>
  Liberty336 has the "politics" of The Bill of Rights. We believe that all humans are created free and equal, and that they have inherent rights, some of these rights being listed in the US Bill of Rights. Liberty336 does not side with the Republican party, because the Republican party has violated the Bill of Rights. Liberty336 does not side with the Democrat party, because the Democrat party has violated the bill of rights.
  <br><br>
  Since one of our goals is breaking out of the "duopoly", We have shared petitions of the Veterans Party of NC, but Liberty336 as a group is NOT affiliated with this party. Liberty336 has shared posts from the Libertarian party, but once again Liberty336 as a group, is not a part of any political party.
