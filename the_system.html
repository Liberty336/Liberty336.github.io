  <h1>The System</h1>
  <h2> The Basics </h2>
  <p style="width: 95vw; font-size: 1.25em;">
  One of the most misunderstood topics that we share with the public is the topic of "The System".
  <br />
  <br />
  "The System", is made up of smaller "systems". For example, you have:
  <br />
  <br />
  1. The Financial system<br />
  2. The Educational system<br />
  3. The Manufacturing system<br />
  4. The Food production system<br />
  5. The Legal system<br />
  6. Nutrition rate (rate of replenishment)<br />
  7. Military system<br />
  8. etc (the list goes on)<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  Let "System" with a capital S refer to the "full stack" System.
  <br />
  Let "system" with a lowercase s refer to an individual system, such as the Financial system.
  <br />
  <br />
  Every civilization has a full stack System, it needs one in order to function and be independent.
  There is a reason why China has its own currency, military, legal system, etc, and that Japan
  has its own separate currency, its own separate military, etc. Each of these nations has its
  own system and its own separate civilization.
  <br /><br />
  When each system is functioning properly, the civilization has a state of homeostasis just as a human body does.
  However, if any of these systems gets too far out of normal calibration, then problems arise, and
  this causes a "ripple effect" among the entire civilization. For example, if the food production system
  gets negatively affected, then people go hungry or starve. The Holodomor in the Soviet Union
  was a man made problem that affected the USSR's food production system, and many starved to death.
  <br>
  <br>
  The importance of maintaining "homeostasis" in a System was well understood by leaders who founded a nation.
  They understood that history tells us that every civilization that did not keep their system in check, was
  either conquered, or it collapsed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Understanding this concept is important for any civilization that wishes to maintain stability.
  This is a concept that oldschool militias focused on and paid attention to. Today,
  it is something many citizens don't think about, nor is it a concept that many understand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ask yourself, when was the last time you were taught about "The System" this way?
  When was the last time you thought to check up on "The System" of your nation?
  Is it something that from now on you'll pay attention to?
